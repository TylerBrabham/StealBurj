Put stealburj.py and .dxf files in the same folder.

From command line, run program using:

	python stealburj.py -i input_file.dxf -o output_file.m

If you do not give an output file name, it will automatically
use the input file name with the .m extension. 

After running program, it will prompt you for the layers you
would like to import. Hit "y" or "n" and press enter for 
each prompt.
